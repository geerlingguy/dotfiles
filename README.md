# geerlingguy's dotfiles

My configuration. Minimalist, but helps save a few thousand keystrokes a day. I use macOS, so I can only guarantee they'll work on a Mac, but I use some of these dotfiles on various linux servers, and they seem to be pretty flexible.

You may also be interested in my [Mac Development Ansible Playbook](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook), which configures a Mac from scratch using Ansible, and incorporates the installation and updating of a set of dotfiles like this one.
